# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Transplant Matching System

## Overview

The AI-Powered Transplant Matching System enhances the organ donation platform by using machine learning to predict match scores between donors and patients. This system analyzes compatibility factors beyond basic blood type matching to provide more accurate and comprehensive match recommendations.

## Features

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Matching
- **Machine Learning Model**: Linear regression model trained on 10,000+ transplant records
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyzes blood type, age, organ type, and compatibility factors
- **Predictive Scoring**: Provides match scores from 0-100% based on historical data patterns
- **Combined Scoring**: Combines AI predictions with traditional compatibility rules

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Analytics
- **Match Statistics**: Real-time statistics on match quality and distribution
- **AI Insights**: Detailed analysis of match patterns and recommendations
- **Quality Assessment**: Categorizes matches as Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor
- **Ranked Recommendations**: Sorts matches by combined compatibility score

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Features
- **Blood Compatibility Matrix**: Advanced blood type compatibility scoring
- **Age Factor Analysis**: Considers age differences in match calculations
- **Organ-Specific Scoring**: Different scoring for different organ types
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates as new donors/patients are added

## How It Works

### 1. Data Training
The AI model is trained on the `transplant_dataa.csv` dataset containing:
- Donor blood type and age
- Patient blood type and age  
- Organ type
- Historical match scores

### 2. Feature Engineering
For each potential match, the system analyzes:
- **Blood Type Compatibility**: Advanced scoring based on blood type rules
- **Age Difference**: Age gap between donor and patient
- **Organ Type**: Specific organ being matched
- **Historical Patterns**: Learned patterns from training data

### 3. Prediction Algorithm
The system uses a linear regression model that:
- Normalizes input features
- Applies learned coefficients
- Generates match scores (0-1 scale)
- Combines with traditional compatibility rules

### 4. Match Recommendations
Results are ranked by:
- **AI Score** (70% weight): Machine learning prediction
- **Basic Compatibility** (30% weight): Traditional blood type rules
- **Combined Score**: Final weighted score

## Technical Implementation

```

## Usage

### 1. Access AI Matching
Navigate to the transplant matching page to see the enhanced AI-powered interface.

### 2. View Match Results
The system automatically:
- Loads and trains the AI model
- Analyzes all donor-patient combinations
- Ranks matches by compatibility score
- Provides detailed insights

### 3. Interpret Results
- **Excellent (â‰¥80%)**: High compatibility, recommended for immediate consideration
- **Good (60-79%)**: Good compatibility, suitable for consideration
- **Fair (40-59%)**: Moderate compatibility, may require additional evaluation
- **Poor (<40%)**: Low compatibility, not recommended

## Dataset Requirements

The AI system requires `transplant_dataa.csv` with columns:
- `Donor_Blood`: Donor blood type
- `Donor_Age`: Donor age
- `Patient_Blood`: Patient blood type  
- `Patient_Age`: Patient age
- `Organ`: Organ type
- `Match_Score`: Historical match score (0-1)

## Benefits

### For Medical Professionals
- **More Accurate Matching**: AI considers multiple factors beyond blood type
- **Ranked Recommendations**: Prioritized list of best matches
- **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive match statistics and insights
- **Time Savings**: Automated analysis of complex compatibility factors

### For Patients
